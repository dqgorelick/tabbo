      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>
        Tabbo is an extension to control your tabs and window through keyboard
        shortcuts. This should help you perform actions quickly such as moving
        tabs around and creating new windows!
      </p>
      <p>
        For the full list of what this extension can do, please take a look at
        the settings page. There you will find descriptions as well as
        animations showing exactly what everything does.
      </p>

      <h2>What data do you store? Why do you need permission for all tabs?</h2>
      <p>Tabbo does not store any data.</p>
      <p>
        Tabbo needs the permission for all tabs to allow screenshotting each tab
        to show you in the manager. We do nothing else with your open windows or
        tabs and do not record any data.
      </p>

      <p>Our code is open source and available to view on Github.</p>

      <h2>
        How do I get in contact with the maintainers regarding an issue or
        feedback?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The fastest way would be to open an issue on the Github repository. You
        could also leave support questions in the store wherever you downloaded
        it, although our response there may be much slower.
